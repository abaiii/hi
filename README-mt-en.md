# Hi, Francie Jiang! [^1]
Francie Jiang actually has a Chinese name called ** Jiang Bing **. ~~(Definitely not a gingerbread man--definitely not--)~~

To put it simply, Francie Jiang is an ~~illiterate~~ husband.

She is currently studying in an ordinary high school in Guang C and enjoys various blessings, including the fact that there is no commissary in the school, there are only six hours of vacation per week, and there is a lot of homework every time she is on vacation. It's a clich√© (although it's not as brutal as some high schools in other parts of the country)

She writes: `[C, C++, Javascript, Python]`

She can say: `[Chinese, English]`

She is studying: `[Chinese, Deutsch, Englisch, Rust, Vue]`

That's all for the part about Francie Jiang as a half-hearted ~~aldehyde zhan siege lion~~ full stack engineer (?).

If you want to know more about Francie Jiang's private boring part(?), you can email `i@francie.cc` to find her contact information(?)

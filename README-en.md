# Hi, Francie Jiang!
Actually, Francie Jiang's gotten a Chinese name called 江柄荏 (Jiang Bing-ren).

In a nutshell, Francie Jiang is an illiterate.

She is currently studying in a senior high located in Guangxi, China, which provides her many benefits, such as:
- having absolutely no convenience stores in campus
- students are only allowed to have a 6-hour break per week and a 2-day break per month. [^1]
- giving students a shit ton of homework every vacation

though the benefits listed above are not as inhumane as the ones of some other senior highs in her country are, she thinks that she is back to one of the concentration camps established during the World Wars.

She writes: `[C, C++, Javascript, Python]`

She speaks: `[Chinese, English]`

She is currently learning: `[Chinese, Deutsch, Englisch, Rust, Vue]`

That's all introduction of the full-stack engineer Francie Jiang. If you want to know more about her, feel free to contact her by mailing to `i@francie.cc` to get her contact info.
